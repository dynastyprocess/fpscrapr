Helps scrape FantasyPros.com by handling rate-limiting/caching/parsing and returning tidy dataframes which can be easily connected to other data sources.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
 
 # install.packages('remotes')
 
 remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/fpscrapr")
```

## Example

All `fpscrapr` functions start with fp.

The fp_rankings function retrieves fantasy ranks from fantasypros.com and right now is only tested with NFL.

```{r example}
library(fpscrapr)

fp_rankings(page = "consensus-cheatsheets", sport = "nfl")

```
